Dual Pricing 2.2
ZenCart 1.5.7

This module replaces group pricing and adds an additional price field to the product as well as allows you to assign "Wholesale" Status to users. Users with Wholesale Status will see the wholesale pricing. You can add multiple levels of wholesale pricing, for example: 20.00-10.00-5.00

THIS REPLACES GROUP PRICING. IF YOU USE GROUP PRICING THEN DON'T USE THIS.

If you're using Zen Cart *other than* 1.5.7, please use the appropriate version of this plugin.  This is *only for* Zen Cart 1.5.7

FAQ's
====================================================================

---------------------------------
How do I use it?
---------------------------------

1. To set 4 levels of wholesale pricing, edit the product and change the wholesale price to be a dash separated list, eg. 50.00-30.00-0.00-25.00

2. Attributes can be set in the same way, but you need to enter the prices in the "Wholesale Price" field and use comma separation, eg. 50.00-30.00-0.00-25,00

3. Pick a customer and click "edit". You will see a new text box under the email address box. The number should be 0, If you change it to a number above 0 then the customer gets wholesale pricing at that level. 

---------------------------------
How do pricing levels work?
---------------------------------

If you set a customer to 1 they'll see level 1 wholesale price instead of the retail price.
If you set it to 2 they will get the second wholesale price.
If they are set to 2 and there is only one wholesale price they will get the level 1 price.
If there is no wholesale price they get retail pricing.

---------------------------------
What about products on sale/special?
---------------------------------

If you put products on sale, your Wholesale level pricing will override that price. So sales only apply to Retail customers.

If you'd like to disable this feature, edit /includes/functions/functions_prices.php

Find these sets of code and comment them out (there should be 4 of them):

//Dual Pricing start - hide specials
//Dual Pricing end - hide specials

---------------------------------
What about taxes?
---------------------------------

By default, your Retail customers (level 0) will be charged sales tax, and wholesale customers (level 1+) will not be charged any sales tax.

If you would like to charge taxes to EVERYONE, then do not include the following file in your installation (or, revert this file back to the original that comes with Zen Cart):
includes\classes\order.php

---------------------------------
Can I add wholesale pricing to my Easy Populate spreadsheet?
---------------------------------

NOTE: if you'd like to add your wholesale prices to Easy Populate, add the following line to
admin\includes\languages\english.php

define('EASYPOPULATE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_FIELDS', 'products_price_w'); //Easy Populate

If you have already added this line for previous fields, then simply add products_price_w with a comma:

define('EASYPOPULATE_CONFIG_CUSTOM_FIELDS', 'products_price_w,WHATEVER_FIELD'); //Easy Populate

---------------------------------
How do I change wording/display style?
---------------------------------

If you want your wholesale customers to see BOTH retail and wholesale pricing (instead of only Wholesale pricing), then uncomment line #71 in this file:
\includes\templates\YOUR_TEMPLATE\templates\tpl_product_info_display.php

If you want to change wording in front of the prices, edit this file:
\includes\languages\english\YOUR_TEMPLATE\product_info.php

You can easily add the following three IDs to your CSS file and control the styles of your text:
#retail
#retailwhole
#whole

This update is soley to increase the speed of a site.  DB queries are taken out of pages tpl_product_info_display.php, tpl_product_music_info_display.php, and functions_prices.php being replaced with $_SESSION variables defined in includes/modules/pages/login/header_php.php.  This saves 3-5 DB queries everytime a product is looked at by a logged in customer.  When looking at the shopping cart and calculating prices for checkout the DB is querried once again to verify that the customer is WS and that the prices are correct.  This is a security check.

V1.4.2 file changes
-includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_product_info_display.php
-includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/templates/tpl_product_music_info_display.php
